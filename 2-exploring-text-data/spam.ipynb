    "To clean up the data set, we've analyzed what words were meaningless in the context of constituting a message. First major filler we've noticed was the markdown tags. We concluded words such as **& lt;#& gt;** are used for formatting purposes and not for anything pertinent to the meaning of the text. Also, we did not come across any words which started with '&' and ended with ';' which wasn't a markdown tag, so the probability of removing important data seems very low. Aside from this, generally accepted stopwords such as a, an, the, on, in, at, by, and etc. were removed as they work to give context but not meaning. List of stopwords were acquired from http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "We also noticed that callback numbers, website urls and email addresses are usually unique or sparse in appearance, however they were strong indicators of spam. For purposes of further analysis we did not remove these words, but rather we replaced them for collective verifiers such as \"replaced_callback_number\" or \"replaced_url\""
